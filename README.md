✨ Whiteboard Web App





A sleek and interactive Whiteboard Web Application built using only Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This app mimics the look and feel of a physical whiteboard while adding powerful digital features like sticky notes, undo-redo, and the ability to download your canvas.

🧾 Project Description

This project is a web-based Whiteboard application built entirely with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, without using any front-end frameworks or libraries. The goal is to replicate the functionality of a physical whiteboard with interactive features that enhance usability and productivity, particularly for online teaching, collaboration, and note-taking.

🎯 Purpose

The main objective of this project is to:

Learn and demonstrate DOM manipulation, event handling, and state management using core web technologies.

Understand how to implement complex UI interactions like drag-and-drop, canvas drawing, and undo-redo history.

Provide users with a smooth and responsive whiteboard experience for sketching, planning, or collaborative discussions.

✨ Key Features

🎨 Drawing Tools

Pencil Tool: Users can draw freely on the whiteboard with selectable colors and line widths.

Eraser Tool: Erase any drawing with an adjustable eraser size.

🗒️ Sticky Notes

Users can create sticky notes to add short text.

Notes can be moved around the board freely using drag-and-drop.

Notes can be minimized/maximized for a cleaner workspace.

🖼️ Sticky Images

Upload and add images to the board.

Images can be resized and repositioned just like sticky notes.

💾 Download Board

Users can download the current whiteboard as an image (PNG) to save or share their work.

↩️ Undo & Redo

Implemented using JavaScript arrays as stacks.

Tracks every drawing stroke or state change.

Allows users to undo previous actions and redo them if needed.
